# Algo-Trader
Automated stock trading bot built in Python. Connects to Alpaca's brokerage API to detect market signal changes using statistical models and machine learning, then executes trades instantly. Features a full data pipeline, SQLite database, risk management controls, and paper trading mode. Currently in active development.

AlgoTrader is an algorithmic trading system built in Python that automates the entire process of finding, evaluating, and executing stock trades without any manual intervention. The project connects directly to the Alpaca brokerage API, which provides access to real US equity markets, real-time price data, and the ability to place orders programmatically. The system is designed from the ground up to be data-driven, meaning every decision the bot makes is based on statistical analysis and machine learning rather than human emotion or intuition.

The core idea behind the project is that markets leave detectable patterns in price and volume data. By analyzing how prices behave over a defined sample period, the system can identify when something meaningful has changed, whether that is a shift in momentum, an unusual spike in volatility, or a breakout from a historical range. When a change is detected and the risk-adjusted score of the opportunity meets the threshold, the bot places an order automatically in under 50 milliseconds.

The project is structured across five phases of development. Phase 1, which is now complete, established the entire foundation of the system. This includes a data pipeline that downloads and stores three years of historical daily price data for ten stocks into a local SQLite database, a broker connection module that interfaces with Alpaca for account management and order execution, a centralized configuration system that manages all settings and API credentials securely, and a logging system that records every action the bot takes for review and debugging.

Upcoming phases will add the signal detection engine using statistical models like Z-score analysis and Bollinger Band squeeze detection, a machine learning layer using XGBoost trained on engineered technical features, a rigorous backtesting framework that validates the strategy against historical data before any money is risked, and a 90-day paper trading period where the bot runs live against real market conditions using simulated capital.

The project follows strict risk management principles throughout, including position sizing limits, a drawdown circuit breaker that halts trading automatically if losses exceed a set threshold, and a hard rule that no real capital is deployed until the system has proven itself through months of paper trading.
